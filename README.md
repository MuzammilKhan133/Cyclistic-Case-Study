This is a case study for one of Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate capstone projects.

Cyclistic is a fictional bike sharing company based and operating in Chicago.

The executive team is on the lookout for ways to drive growth and is considering a marketing strategy that aims to convert a large portion of casual riders into members.

As a junior data analyst on Cyclistic's marketing analytics team, I've been tasked with presenting to executives my findings and recommendations once I've thoroughly explored, processed and analyzed any relevant data.
